				<p>Hello! I'm Zainab, a senior computer science student at Oakland University. Fun fact about me: I'm <strong>really</strong> bad at fun facts.</p>
				<p>As a student at OU, I have acquired experience working with many object-oriented languages, such as Java and C. On my own, I enjoy tinkering with things on the front and backend with JavaScript as well as some scripting with Python. I like making tools that are useful to people; I strongly believe software should be used to change lives for the better!
				<p>In my free time, I get a kick out of making things with my hands: I like crocheting scarves, blankets, and other odd tidbits (I've made snitches from Harry Potter and Pokeballs as well) for friends and family. I also enjoy drawing and reading. On any given day, you'll find me doing any combination of these three - I've got busy hands and a busy mind!</p>
